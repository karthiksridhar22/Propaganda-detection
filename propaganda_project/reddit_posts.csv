Why does homelessness in the US look so bad when the data suggests it isn't that bad,"Hello, homelessness is a problem in the US, as with anywhere, and I have always wanted to fix it. But, after doing some research, I found that wealthy European countries such as the Netherlands have similar rates of urbanization and homelessness(US with .18% homelessness and the Netherlands with .23% homelessness), though the Netherlands is more urbanized than the US(\~84% population in an urban area in the US, vs \~94% in the Netherlands) or New Zealand, with a higher homelessness rate of .86% , and an urbanization rate of \~87%. But my question is why is homelessness in these places less visible? Is it because the homeless population is more cared for by those societies than in the US or is it simply that they are good at building around their homeless population?  
Sources: Urbanization rates are taken from wikipedia, which cites the statistics as from World Bank, among other sources, whereas homelessness rates are taken from the OECD report on homelessness by country.  
Links: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization\_by\_sovereign\_state and https://www.oecd.org/els/family/HC3-1-Homeless-population.pdf The OECD data is a little old but all of the referenced country's are within a few years of each other, would prefer more recent data though.  
Additionally, here is an article outlining the homelessness crisis in the US: https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/addressing-the-u-s-homelessness-crisis/",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1c71m4h/why_does_homelessness_in_the_us_look_so_bad_when/,https://redd.it/1c71m4h

Given Haiti's history and the ongoing crisis there, what are the arguments for and against France paying these reparations?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1cavusd/what_are_the_arguments_for_and_against_france/,https://redd.it/1cavusd
Have any U.S. states successfully implemented evidence-based policies around transgender health?,"In a context of unprecedented numbers of [national](https://translegislation.com/bills/2024/US) and [state-level bills](https://translegislation.com/) focused on [LGBTQ+ folks](https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights-2024), and particularly the transgender and nonbinary folks, which U.S. states (if any) have been successful in passing evidence-based policies regarding the transgender health? If so, what factors contributed to those policy-making processes? If not, what barriers exist in states where policies are arguably not based on the evidence?

There seems to be broad [consensus among clinicians](https://glaad.org/medical-association-statements-supporting-trans-youth-healthcare-and-against-discriminatory) in support of health care that meets specific needs of transgender people, and [standards of care](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2805345) that emphasize the need to consider potential benefits and harms of any medical procedure. Scholarly studies have also [repeatedly found associations between structural stigma, including restrictive policies, and poor mental health outcomes](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(23)00312-2/fulltext) among LGBTQ+ folks.

With the understanding that attitudes toward the LGBTQ+ community closely tied to cultural, moral and [religious beliefs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-022-00762-3), is there a way to reach some kind of consensus on evidence about the health needs of trans folks, and to implement policies accordingly?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1byxf40/have_any_us_states_successfully_implemented/,https://redd.it/1byxf40
Where can I find a list of important legislation passed from each administration?,"I've been searching and this is ridiculously difficult to find. I just want a simple, clean website that shows drop down lists of, for example:  
\- Here's everything the FTC has done under Biden, Trump, Obama, etc.  
\- Here's everything the Agriculture dept has passed under each president...  
\- Etc  
  
If this was created and made EASILY accessible for all Americans, it would be so helpful.

What are the arguments for and against the idea that the U.S. and U.K. failed to provide adequate security assurances to Ukraine under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum?,"The [1994 Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum) was signed by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Under it, Ukraine agreed to give up the nuclear weapons inherited after the Soviet dissolution in exchange for security assurances, especially from the U.S. and U.K., respecting its territorial integrity and political independence (another [source](https://policymemos.hks.harvard.edu/files/policymemos/files/2-23-22_ukraine-the_budapest_memo.pdf?m=1645824948))


In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and ongoing occupation of Crimea and parts of the Donbas region, there has been significant debate about whether the U.S. and U.K. have lived up to their commitments under the Budapest Memorandum.

Did the US and UK actually fail to provide promised assurances?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1cdcztu/what_are_the_arguments_for_and_against_the_idea/,https://redd.it/1cdcztu
What are valid arguments for and against enacting right to disconnect laws?,"Recently, the Australian government enacted right to disconnect laws much to the unease of employer groups. They argue that this move is fraught with uncertainty on what exactly constitutes ""unreasonable"" contact. Likewise, employer groups in the Philippines baulked at the introduction of a similar bill last December saying it would disrupt ""workplace peace"" and deter foreign investment.

How valid are these points and are there ways to prevent these laws from resulting in undue litigation against employers?

What are the pros and cons of the Biden administration's proposed capital gains tax increase to a top marginal rate of 44.6%?,"The Biden administration has presented its [revenue proposals for the 2025 fiscal year,](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/General-Explanations-FY2025.pdf) which include increases to the capital gains and net investment income tax rates for those whose taxable income exceeds $1 million.

Dissecting the Wage Policy-Housing Affordability Nexus in a Post-Pandemic Context,"Hello r/NeutralPolitics,  
  
The post-pandemic economy has cast a stark light on the societal challenges posed by the widening gap between wage growth and housing costs. My research, ""[Wage Policies and the Housing Affordability Crisis – A Critical Analysis of an Escalating Dilemma](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379181082_Wage_Policies_and_the_Housing_Affordability_Crisis_-_A_Critical_Analysis_of_an_Escalating_Dilemma),"" explores the complex nexus of wage stagnation, housing market dynamics, and broader economic pressures, and how these factors contribute to rising income inequality and a worsening crisis in housing affordability.  
  
With a basis in empirical data, the study critically examines the effects of urban planning, globalization, and monetary policy on housing markets, and advocates for evidence-based policy initiatives aimed at ensuring economic equity and housing stability. The objective is to address systemic challenges and avert threats to societal harmony and economic sustainability.  
  
In light of this research, I would like to invite a discussion on the following questions:  
  
What empirical data most convincingly illustrates the correlation between wage policies and housing affordability, and how have these dynamics shifted post-pandemic?

How can case studies of urban planning, globalization, and monetary policy inform policy actions that address housing affordability?

What are the evidence-based recommendations that emerge from this research for fostering economic equity and stability in housing markets?  
  
For a more comprehensive view of the findings and for use as a basis for discussion, the full paper is available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379181082_Wage_Policies_and_the_Housing_Affordability_Crisis_-_A_Critical_Analysis_of_an_Escalating_Dilemma).

What actually changed upon passage of CA SB14?,"I've seen a number of articles about this bill that is now law, but reading the text of the bill hasnt given me much clarity into what actually was changed. SB14 was a recently-enacted California law to change the criminal penalties for human trafficking of a minor.

https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVersionsCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB14

The articles I originally read indicated there were concerns about the specific ages in the bill, which caused an amendment but I see no mention of age in the final bill.

Other [articles](https://calmatters.org/justice/2023/12/child-trafficking-new-california-laws-2024/) make mention of other concerns but I see nothing in the final version addressing those concerns. I also see no mention of the changes in jail terms mentioned in articles such as [this](https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/california-bill-to-make-purchasing-child-sex-felony-amended-weakens-certain-penalties/)

I also attempted to read the actual law, I found [this](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=236.1.) which seems to have penalties higher than those 1 year claimed in some of the articles.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1cg4k3d/what_actually_changed_upon_passage_of_ca_sb14/,https://redd.it/1cg4k3d
Separatism vs. balkanization,"[Separatism](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/separatism) is the belief that a group of people of a particular heritage, race, religion, ethnic group, etc. should gain independence or autonomy from a ruling country. 

[Balkanization](https://www.cairn.info/revue-l-europe-en-formation-2008-3-page-55.htm) is a term coined after looking at the history of the Balkan region over the past 150-200 years, and is often used by some people to negatively describe what separatist movements advocate for.

I'd like to learn more on this topic, and maybe try to form an opinion based on what I'll read.

For context: I'm French. France is a unitary, [centrally-controlled](https://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-276/lecture-3) state, and one of the basic principals of our [constitution](https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/en/constitution-of-4-october-1958) is ""indivisibility"". We generally believe that we are one People and the law should apply equally everywhere to everyone. But there are varying separatist movements in France, such as in Corsica, Bretagne, Catalogne, Pays Basque, but also in overseas territories. There are also separatists movements in other European countries ([Scotland](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/will-support-for-scottish-independence-go-away/), [Catalonia](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/05/the-ghost-of-franco-still-haunts-catalonia/), [Transnistria](https://apnews.com/article/transnistria-moldova-russia-ukraine-war-99575f5e67c222edced149031417bd5a)...) and all over the world ([Xinjiang](https://www.uyghurcongress.org/en/east-turkestan-2/), [Western Sahara](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14115273.amp)...). Some left-wing movements support or take part in them ([Scottish Greens](https://greens.scot/yes/for-people-for-planet), [Plaid Cymru](https://www.partyof.wales/annibyniaeth_i_gymru_welsh_independence)), some oppose them ([PTB in Belgium](https://www.ptb.be/programme/we-are-one-pour-lunite-de-la-belgique-0), in French). Same goes for centrist and conservative movements ([here about Brittany, France](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2022/04/09/brittany-lays-claim-to-autonomy-in-corsica-s-footsteps_5980128_7.html), [here about Corsica, France](https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/french-presidential-candidates-divided-on-granting-corsica-autonomy/), or [here about Quebec](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/action-democratique-du-quebec-adq)).

I would like to read opposing arguments from both sides, what different ideologies support, on what principle or evidence, and maybe have access to ressources. I'm sure authors have probably theorized on this subject.

Does separatism divide people? Does it weaken nations? Does it bring political power closer to the people/workers? Does it depend on the nature of the separatist process - is it a bourgeois process or a worker's movement? Where do you draw the line? Should one make their opinion on a case by case basis? What criteria would you use? There must be so many different cases throughout continents. How do opposing political groups articulate their common fight for separatism? etc. So many questions come to my mind as you can tell.

TL;DR: what makes a separatist movement ""good"" or ""bad""?

Has the Fair Work Act of 2009 affected wage growth in Australia in any way?,"I recently read an [interview with Bill Kelty and Paul Keating](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/kelty-and-keating-s-big-fix-for-enterprise-bargaining-20220904-p5bfaa) wherein they criticized the [Fair Work Act of 2009](https://www.alrc.gov.au/publication/grey-areas-age-barriers-to-work-in-commonwealth-laws-dp-78/2-recruitment-and-employment-law/the-fair-work-act-2009-cth/) for its supposed negative effects on productivity and wage growth. The Business Council of Australia has also made [similar criticisms](https://www.bca.com.au/four-ways-in-which-the-fair-work-act-is-reducing-productivity). On the other hand, the [Australian Council of Trade Unions released their own research paper](https://www.actu.org.au/media/123890/Working_By_Numbers_Separating_rhetoric_and_reality_on_Australian_productivity_v2.pdf) which absolved the law and attributed the declining productivity rate to underinvestment in skills and infrastructure, managerial complacency, and changing terms of trade, among other factors.
